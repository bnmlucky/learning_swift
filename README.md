# I am starting to learn Swift today.

## I plan to add 1000 easy Leetcode problem in Swift to this repo.  I have no idea how long this is going to take me, but I expect (suspect?) 3 years.  Let's go.  Today is April 24, 2024.  

Just to trigger people, I need to say that I'll be learning Swift listening to Taylor Swift.  
She is the best, raw and real.  Haters are gonna hate, potatoes are gonna potate and I am going to love her forever.

Byeeeee!
